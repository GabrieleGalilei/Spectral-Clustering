To run this project, open 'prog.m'.
Here you can set the dataset and the parameters you are going to work with:
simply comment whatever you do not want (you can only choose 1 per block).

- Dataset: circle, spiral, landmines;
- normlapl: unnorm, symnorm; it specifies if the un normalized Laplacian matrix or the normalized one is going to be used
- solvels: backslash, conjgrad, gmres, lanczos; it specifies how the sparse linear system in the computation of eigenvalues is solved.
- clustmeth: kmeans, kmedoids, ward, euclidean; it specifies the clustering algorithm (Ward and euclidean refer to hierachical clustering).

sigma (requested to be 1)
k = number of neighbors.
num =  maximum number of clusters.
tol = tolerance used in iterative algorithms.
maxit = maximum number of iterations used in iterative algorithms.
