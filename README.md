# Spectral Clustering
Spectral Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that effectively divides a dataset of points into distinct groups by emphasizing the similarity between points within the same cluster. Unlike algorithms like k-means that rely on the assumption of convex or globular clusters based on euclidean distance,

Spectral Clustering excels in the presence of different densities and shapes, such as intertwined spirals. This is because it does not make strong assumptions about the shape of the clusters. Additionally, Spectral Clustering is free from the issues of local minima and the need to restart the algorithm with different initial guesses as it is based on the solution of a sparse linear system.
